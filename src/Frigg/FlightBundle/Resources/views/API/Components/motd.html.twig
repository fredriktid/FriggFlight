        <p>Welcome to our documentation sandbox where you should find the necessary information in order to start building those beautiful apps with up-to-date flight data, delivered from us in a completely RESTful data format. Choose between JSON, XML, or even HTML as your datatype. You may even run live tests on this page by clicking on the "Sandbox" link under each topic. So say goodbye to <a href="http://www.avinor.no/avinor/trafikk/50_Flydata" target="_blank">Avinors' old API</a> and save both time and energy with the modern <strong>FlyAPI.no</strong>.</p>
        <p>Please keep in mind that site is still under development so many things are still subject to change, though the main structure is pretty solid. As always, feel free to <a href="">contact us</a> if you have any questions regarding this service or the technology behind it.</p>
